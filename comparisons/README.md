# Comparisons

## Head-to-Head Analysis for Informed Decisions

This section provides detailed comparisons to help you choose between similar tools and approaches. Each comparison presents both options fairly, acknowledges trade-offs, and provides clear recommendations for different situations.

## Comparison Index

| Comparison | Decision Being Made |
|------------|---------------------|
| [Claude vs GPT](claude-vs-gpt.md) | Which model family for your work |
| [Cursor vs Aider](cursor-vs-aider.md) | Which AI coding assistant |
| [Cloud vs Local](cloud-vs-local.md) | API services vs self-hosted models |

## Quick Decision Guide

### "Which model should I use?"

```
Need maximum code quality? -----> Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Need broad knowledge base? -----> GPT-4o
Need very long context? --------> Gemini 1.5 Pro
Need to minimize cost? ---------> GPT-4o-mini or Claude Haiku
Need privacy/offline? ----------> Local models (Llama, etc.)
```

**More detail:** [Claude vs GPT](claude-vs-gpt.md)

### "Which coding assistant should I use?"

```
Want full IDE experience? ------> Cursor
Prefer terminal workflow? ------> Aider
Need VS Code specifically? -----> Copilot or Cursor
Want free option? --------------> Codeium
```

**More detail:** [Cursor vs Aider](cursor-vs-aider.md)

### "Should I use cloud or local models?"

```
High volume processing? --------> Consider local
Privacy critical? --------------> Local required
Maximum capability needed? -----> Cloud (for now)
Experimenting/learning? --------> Cloud is easier
Budget constrained but high volume? -> Local
```

## How to Use These Comparisons

### For Quick Decisions

- Read the summary table at the top
- Check the "When to Use" sections
- Make your choice and move on

### For Informed Decisions

- Read the full comparison
- Consider your specific constraints
- Test with your actual use cases
- Revisit as your needs evolve

### For Team Decisions

- Share the relevant comparison
- Discuss which factors matter most
- Pilot both options if possible
- Document the decision rationale

---

## Comparison Philosophy

These comparisons aim to be:

**Honest**
- Both options have strengths and weaknesses
- No option is universally better
- Trade-offs are made explicit

**Practical**
- Focused on real-world usage
- Based on experience, not just specs
- Acknowledges that context matters

**Current**
- Reflects state as of writing
- Notes what might change
- Encourages periodic re-evaluation

## Factors That Appear Across Comparisons

### Capability
What can each option do? Where does each excel or struggle?

### Cost
Direct costs and indirect costs (time, effort, infrastructure).

### Experience
How pleasant is it to use day-to-day?

### Flexibility
Can it adapt to different needs? How locked-in are you?

### Ecosystem
What tools, integrations, and community support exist?

### Future
Where is each option heading? What's the trajectory?

*The goal isn't to find the "best" option. It's to find the best option for your situation. These comparisons help you make that determination.*
