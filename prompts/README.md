# Prompts

## A Library of Battle-Tested Prompts

This section contains ready-to-use prompts organized by domain. Each prompt has been refined through practical use. They serve both as templates to use directly and as examples of effective prompt construction.

## Organization

| Category | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| [Coding](coding/) | Development, debugging, review, refactoring |
| [Writing](writing/) | Technical documentation, communication, content |
| [Analysis](analysis/) | Data analysis, research, decision support |
| [System Prompts](system-prompts/) | Reusable system prompt templates |

## How to Use This Library

### Direct Use

Copy prompts verbatim and fill in the bracketed placeholders:

```
[your code here]
[describe your requirements]
[paste the error message]
```

### Adaptation

Use prompts as starting points:
- Modify language for your context
- Add domain-specific constraints
- Combine multiple prompts for complex tasks
- Adjust depth and format to your needs

### Learning

Study prompts to understand effective patterns:
- Note how context is provided
- Observe how tasks are specified
- See how outputs are structured
- Learn constraint and instruction patterns

---

## Prompt Quality Criteria

Every prompt in this library meets these standards:

**Specific**
- Clear task definition
- Unambiguous instructions
- Defined output format

**Complete**
- Necessary context included
- Constraints specified
- Edge cases addressed

**Practical**
- Tested in real scenarios
- Produces consistent results
- Appropriate length
