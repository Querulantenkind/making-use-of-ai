## Analysis Principles

**Start with the question**
Know what you're trying to learn before diving into analysis. The question shapes the approach.

**Acknowledge uncertainty**
Good analysis quantifies confidence. "The data suggests..." is more honest than "The data proves..."

**Consider alternatives**
Strong analysis considers multiple hypotheses, not just the one you expect to confirm.

**Separate observation from interpretation**
First report what you see, then explain what it might mean.

**Act on findings**
Analysis without action is trivia. Connect insights to decisions and next steps.

*Analysis transforms information into insight and insight into action. Use these prompts to think more clearly about the problems you face.*
