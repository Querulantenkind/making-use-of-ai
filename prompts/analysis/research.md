## Quick Reference

### Research Quality Checklist

```
Before relying on research findings:

[ ] Multiple sources consulted
[ ] Sources are credible and current
[ ] Contrary evidence considered
[ ] Biases identified and accounted for
[ ] Limitations acknowledged
[ ] Conclusions follow from evidence
[ ] Actionable next steps identified
```

### Asking Good Research Questions

Good research questions are:
- **Specific** - Not "how do databases work" but "how does PostgreSQL handle concurrent writes"
- **Answerable** - Can be resolved with available information
- **Relevant** - Connected to a decision or action
- **Scoped** - Not trying to understand everything at once

*Research is not about finding the answer. It's about understanding the question deeply enough to find useful answers. These prompts help you investigate systematically.*
