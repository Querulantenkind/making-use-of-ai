## Writing Principles

**Clarity over cleverness**
Simple, direct language beats impressive vocabulary. Your goal is understanding, not admiration.

**Structure matters**
Good organization makes content scannable. Use headers, lists, and visual hierarchy.

**Know your audience**
Technical depth should match reader expertise. What's obvious to you may not be to them.

**Edit ruthlessly**
First drafts are for getting ideas down. Good writing emerges from revision.
