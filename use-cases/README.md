## How to Use These Guides

### Learning Approach

1. **Read through once** to understand the overall flow
2. **Try with your own project** adapting prompts to your context
3. **Iterate and refine** based on what works for you

### Adapting Prompts

The prompts shown are examples. Adapt them by:
- Replacing technology references with your stack
- Adjusting detail level based on task complexity
- Adding project-specific context from your `.cursorrules` or similar

### Tools Assumed

These walkthroughs assume access to:
- A capable AI model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, or similar)
- An AI coding assistant (Cursor, Aider, or similar)
- Standard development tools (Git, terminal, editor)

## Common Patterns Across Use Cases

### The Exploration-Before-Action Pattern

```
1. Understand the current state
2. Identify what needs to change
3. Plan the approach
4. Execute incrementally
5. Verify at each step
```

### The Scope Management Pattern

```
1. Start with a clear, limited goal
2. Complete that goal fully
3. Only then expand scope
4. Resist feature creep during execution
```

### The Verification Pattern

```
1. Ask AI to make a change
2. Review the change before accepting
3. Test the change works
4. Commit with clear message
5. Continue to next change
```

## What These Aren't

These use cases are **not**:
- Step-by-step tutorials (adapt to your situation)
- The only way to approach these problems
- Guaranteed to work identically for you

They **are**:
- Proven patterns that work in practice
- Starting points for developing your own workflows
- Examples of effective AI collaboration

## Choosing Your Starting Point

**If you're new to AI-assisted development:**
Start with [Building a CLI Tool](building-a-cli-tool.md) - it's the most complete walkthrough.

**If you're debugging something right now:**
Jump to [Debugging Production Issues](debugging-production-issue.md).

**If you just joined a new project:**
[Understanding Legacy Code](legacy-code-understanding.md) will help you ramp up faster.

**If your docs are a mess:**
[Documentation Overhaul](documentation-overhaul.md) provides a systematic approach.

**If you're facing a migration:**
[Code Migration Project](code-migration-project.md) breaks down the complexity.
